I now see five posts on the site when I go to "VIEW SITE," but only three are visible on the back end. So I have two posts that I cannot change and cannot delete.

The simplest improvement The Grid could make, and it shouldn't be difficult, is to allow anyone signed in to The Grid to have a link on any page of the site they are viewing to edit that page. WordPress figured this out years ago, and it eludes me why The Grid didn't include it from the beginning.
