It's the morning after my first post. Here are my experiences so far:

I don't know why I would have expected the staff of The Grid, who have massacred the task of simple customer relations during development, to do a better job communicating with their customers in their actual application, but I did. I was of course disappointed.

Here's the message I received Wednesday telling me that my beta was activated.

I clicked on the link provided (just below the portion shown here) and found a nice welcome screen allowing me to choose whether to sign in with Facebook, with Google, with maybe one other, or with Github. I'm a big believer in using a different robust password for each site I use, so I was disappointed I couldn't log in with a password unique to The Grid. Because I use Github less than the other two, I chose it.

The Grid thoughtfully provides instructions for use, but I somehow lost them in the **many** screens provided and forged ahead without them. Later I came back to them and discovered they didn't tell me much I hadn't already figured out.

The biggest surprise to me, having cut my teeth on WordPress, is that when you make a post, it doesn't show up immediately. It makes sense now that I think about it, because I'm sure The Grid has to analyze it and apply its AI engine to it, but I was frustrated that I couldn't view my site right after posting to it.

For what it's worth, I **still** haven't been able to view my site more than 12 hours after posting to it. When I click on the link that says "VIEW SITE," I get yet another one of those help screens, with this person shown as the user. Who is this?

When will I be able to see my site? I'm posting this in the blind hope that, one day, I will be able to see it online.
