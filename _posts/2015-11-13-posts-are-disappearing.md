I have posted four times to this site. One has disappeared entirely. The other three show up on the site view, but when I go the site on the backend and try to open them up as if I want to edit them, it tells me that there are no posts at all. They're visible online but, at least for now, uneditable.

It's inconceivable to me now that The Grid has 100 happy users, let alone 4,000\. I get the impression that they must have abandoned efforts to make the interface user-friendly and are just throwing more and more beta users at it in its unimproved form.
