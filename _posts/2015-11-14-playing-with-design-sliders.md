I am enjoying playing with the various sliders and then checking to see the resulting change in the look of the site. It took me a couple of passes to figure out that I should change only one element at a time. If I change more, then I can't tell which change I am seeing.

For example, the first image is the typeface I get when I choose the neutral setting.

The second image is the typeface I get when I choose the most formal setting.

I am unable to post the third image that shows the typeface I get when I choose the most casual setting, because The Grid inexplicably won't provide me the + sign here that I need to post an image. For what it's worth, the typeface for most casual looks a lot like the one for neutral.
