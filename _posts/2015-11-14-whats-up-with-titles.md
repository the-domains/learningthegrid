Every one of my posts has a title, and every one except the first has a Description. Yet when The Grid presents them on the site, only one - the first - has a visible title.

Perhaps this is someone's idea of a hyper-clean design, but it's puzzling to me that I have not yet found any way to make the titles visible, regardless of the changes I make to the Design Sliders.
