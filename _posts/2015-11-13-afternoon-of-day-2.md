Okay, I can see my site now. Here are the concerns I have about it so far:

* The tiny thumbnail I posted - presumably some staff person at The Grid - has been blown up to a huge size and has become so pixellated as to be almost unrecognizable.
* I posted images just below the text I wanted them to accompany, but when they show up online, the images are three or four paragraphs above the text to which they relate.
* The menu system is clean to a fault. It would make all the sense in the world for me to be able while viewing a page online to be able to click on a link to edit that page, but that's not the way it works. If I want to edit a page, I must back all the way out and come at that page from the backend. Weird.

* I never found the version of this page I had typed earlier. I must have deleted it by mistake. For what it's worth, I'm confident I didn't get any warning that I was about to delete it, and I'm not at all confident that I was the one who deleted it.
* In summary, I have written five posts. There are only two that are visible on the site. That's a good percentage for a batting average, but a little scary for a web editing program.
